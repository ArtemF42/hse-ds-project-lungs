# Semantic Segmentation of Lungs on X-Ray Images
This repository contains the implementation of a semantic segmentation model for lung detection in chest X-ray images. The project was conducted as part of the "Research Seminar: An Introduction to AI" course at HSE University.

### Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the [Chest X-ray Dataset for Tuberculosis Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtapendu/chest-x-ray-lungs-segmentation), which provides annotated X-ray images for lung segmentation and tuberculosis detection.

### Model
Segmentation is performed using the UNet architecture, which is commonly used for biomedical image segmentation tasks. The model architecture in this project closely follows the design proposed in the [original UNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
